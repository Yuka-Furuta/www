### Position Overview

Space Cubics develops onboard computers for spacecraft and provides
software platforms where high reliability is essential.

For candidates without prior experience in embedded systems or
spacecraft development, you will first be involved in developing
applications running on Zephyr RTOS and Linux, programs for testing
and CI, setting up development environments, and writing
documentation, mainly in the middleware and application layers.

Concretely, this includes development of NASA cFS used on spacecraft,
CubeSat Space Protocol (libcsp), and tools needed for development such
as protocol viewers. For those who wish to work on lower level
software in the future, we will gradually assign low level tasks,
starting from simpler work and stepping down the stack over time.

By collaborating with engineers inside and outside the team, you can
develop your skills in this role and ultimately aim to contribute to
the development of next generation space systems.

### What We Look For

- Able to explain the intent behind code you have written
- Able to clearly explain what you do not understand

- Our development work is themed around “space” and often involves
  unfamiliar or unprecedented areas that are not usually considered in
  typical embedded development. Because of this, we think this role is
  a good fit for someone who has the patience and enthusiasm to
  steadily research areas they do not know yet and persistently search
  for the best possible solution.
