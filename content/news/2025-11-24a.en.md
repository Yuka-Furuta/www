title = "Correction to the Space Science and Technology Conference Announcement"

On October 31, 2025, we published the announcement titled 
[Exhibition at the 69th Space Sciences and Technology Conference](@/news/2025-10-31.en.md).
However, we have identified an error in the "Information PDF" that
was provided for those who wished to schedule a meeting during the
exhibition period.

In the PDF, we stated, “If you would like to schedule a meeting to
discuss our new products or developments during the event, please
make a reservation via Google Calendar or email.”
However, the calendar could not be edited, and therefore reservations
could not be made using this method.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and confusion caused by
this incorrect information.

### Regarding the Replacement of the PDF
Please download the revised PDF containing the correct application
instructions from the [information PDF](/files/sc-ukaren69-meeting.pdf).

The link in the previously published article has also been updated
with the revised PDF.

We kindly ask those who wish to schedule a meeting to review the updated
PDF before submitting a request.
