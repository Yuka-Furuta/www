— Achieving both advanced onboard processing and high reliability to support diverse missions in the New Space era —

November 24, 2025<br>
Space Cubics Inc.

Space Cubics Inc. (Head Office: Sapporo, Hokkaido; CEO: Yasushi Shoji,
hereinafter “Space Cubics”), a JAXA startup that develops highly
reliable computers designed to operate in space and other extreme
environments, today announced “SC-OBC Module V1,” a high-end onboard
computer (OBC) for New Space applications. The product is based on the
results of joint studies with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
(JAXA).

SC-OBC Module V1 adopts AMD Versal Adaptive SoC as its main
processor. It is a space computer module that combines the advanced
onboard processing capability required by spacecraft that support
diverse missions in the New Space era with the reliability needed to
operate in the harsh environment of space.

In recent space missions, the amount of data that the OBC must handle
has increased dramatically due to the higher performance of onboard
sensors. At the same time, constraints on satellite to ground
communication bandwidth have made real-time “edge processing” of data
in orbit increasingly important. To address these challenges, SC-OBC
Module V1 adopts the Versal Adaptive SoC, a heterogeneous platform
that integrates a CPU for scalar processing, FPGA for hardware
acceleration, and an AI Engine for vector processing. This enables
efficient execution of the entire chain of operations, from high-speed
input of large volumes of data from optical sensors, synthetic
aperture radar (SAR), and LiDAR, to edge processing that involves
vector computation, and recording to large-capacity storage.

SC-OBC Module V1 is scheduled for official release in spring 2026.

This computer module is also planned for adoption in a next-generation
domestically developed lunar lander (Series 3 lander) that is being
developed by ispace inc., a space startup engaged in lunar resource
development, for a lunar mission currently scheduled for launch in
2028.

A development-stage SC-OBC Module V1 will be exhibited at the 69th
Space Science and Technology Conference, held in Sapporo, Japan from
November 25 to 28, 2025 (Booth No. C-22).

### Key Features of SC-OBC Module V1

#### High Performance
The FPGA and AI Engine enable high-speed execution of
compute-intensive image processing and AI inference workloads. Linux,
running on multi-core Cortex-A72 processors, supports compute-heavy
applications using a broad ecosystem of open-source software. By
leveraging OpenCV and machine learning frameworks, complex algorithms
can be rapidly implemented using existing libraries.

#### High Reliability
A dual core Arm Cortex R5F real-time processing unit (RPU), configured
in lockstep mode and running the Zephyr real-time operating system
(RTOS), ensures reliable execution of operations that require real
time performance and functional safety, such as attitude control and
power management.

In addition to the main Versal processor, the module includes a
flash-based FPGA, “Microchip IGLOO2,” which has high resistance to
single event upsets (SEUs), as a Safety Processor. Built using triple
modular redundancy (TMR) logic, this processor performs health
monitoring of the Versal device, power cycling control, and monitoring
of temperature, voltage, and current, enabling early detection of
system anomalies and preventing permanent failures.

#### Flexibility
By integrating only the essential functions required of an onboard
computer into the module itself, mission specific interfaces can be
implemented flexibly on a carrier board. This modular approach makes
it easier to adapt to different spacecraft and reuse existing software
assets

In addition to flight models that have completed reliability testing,
cost-effective development models are also available. Both variants
maintain software compatibility, helping users reduce development
costs and improve overall development efficiency.

### Target Spacecraft and Missions

#### Earth Observation / Remote Sensing Satellites
Supports real-time onboard processing of high-resolution imagery and
SAR data, reducing communication load and enabling near-real-time
analysis.

#### Exploration Spacecraft (Planetary / Lunar Missions)
In bandwidth-constrained deep-space environments, data can be
processed onboard and only essential results transmitted to Earth.

### Comment from Takeshi Hakamada, CEO & Founder, ispace inc.

“We are delighted to welcome the announcement by Space Cubics of
‘SC-OBC Module V1,’ a high-end onboard computer for New Space. Space
Cubics played an important role in the development of ispace’s Mission
1 and Mission 2, and we are very pleased to see them announce a new
product that responds to the needs of the New Space era, based on the
results of joint studies with JAXA.

‘SC-OBC Module V1’ combines advanced processing capability with
extremely high reliability. It is expected to become a core component
in our future lunar missions, where real-time edge processing of large
volumes of sensor data is a key factor for success.

ispace highly values the robustness, flexibility, and high processing
capability of this advanced space computer and looks forward to
further strengthening its collaboration with Space Cubics as we work
together to open up a new stage of space development.”

### About Space Cubics Inc.

Space Cubics Inc., founded in 2018, is a JAXA startup that designs and
develops high reliability computers and avionics for spacecraft and
satellites operating in the harsh environment of space. By providing
affordable yet reliable space computers, the company works to reduce
spacecraft development costs and lower the barrier to entering space
development, and has supplied computers for a wide range of missions,
including satellites, exploration spacecraft, and space robots.

Rather than depending only on very expensive, fully radiation hardened
parts, Space Cubics applies the techniques and know how it has
accumulated through many launches and on orbit operations to deliver
robust avionics while keeping total system cost under control. This
approach helps startups, established companies, and research
organizations carry out ambitious space missions without prohibitive
avionics costs.

With the mission of creating an era where anyone can go to the Moon,
Space Cubics will continue to develop and provide highly reliable
space grade computers.
